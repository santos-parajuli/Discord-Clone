## Technologies

### Next.js

Next.js stands as a robust React framework, chosen for its versatility in facilitating server-side rendering, static site generation, and SEO optimization. The framework excels in enhancing performance and user experience, making it the ideal choice for developing a responsive and efficient front-end.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, streamlines UI development through pre-defined atomic classes. In our project, Tailwind CSS is employed for its flexibility and speed, allowing developers to compose highly customized interfaces. ShadCN UI components further enhance the design, offering a visually appealing and customizable foundation for the application's user interface.

### MongoDB and Prisma ORM

MongoDB, a NO-SQL database, has been chosen for its scalability and flexibility. Storing data in BSON format, MongoDB accommodates unstructured or semi-structured data, aligning with the dynamic nature of the messaging app. Prisma ORM complements MongoDB by providing an open-source toolkit for efficient database operations, offering a seamless integration that simplifies data management.

### Socket.io

Critical to the project's success is Socket.io, a library facilitating real-time, bidirectional communication between clients. This technology is essential for achieving instant message delivery, a core feature in the Discord clone. Socket.io employs WebSocket as its primary communication mechanism, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.

### Clerk

Clerk, a powerful authentication tool, is considered for user authentication in the project. It offers a robust solution for handling user login, registration, and password recovery seamlessly. Integrating Clerk into the project enhances security and provides a user-friendly authentication process.

### LiveKit

LiveKit, another key component in our technology stack, is incorporated to enable high-quality video and audio communication. As a scalable platform, LiveKit enhances the project's capabilities by facilitating the implementation of video calls, ensuring a seamless and reliable experience for users engaging in virtual conversations.
